## How to install

### Using Git

```

### Install npm dependencies after installing

## How to run

### Running in development mode

### Running tests

ItÂ´s a good practice to do tests at your code, so a sample of how to do that in Jest is also included in the `/app/**/tests/` directory

```

```
